# coursepickerv2

A Wellesley Course Scheduler allows the user to select Wellesley courses and see them visually on a calendar. The course information was scraped from the Wellesley Course Browser using Selenium in Python. This project is inspired by [coursepicker](https://github.com/isabelleli/coursepicker), a final project implemented in Java with two teammates.
